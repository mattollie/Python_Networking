# Python_Networking
# These files are simple TCP and UDP socket programming projects. Lab's 1 and 2 are encryption and decryption algorithms and the rest are client/server python programs.
# If you wish to run these programs, simply load the client.py to your client and the server.py to your server and run them simultaneously either in an IDE or on your command line.
# Please note that the client and server programs rely on the encryption and decryption algorithms so make sure to have those files in the same directory so the program can find them.
# Also please note that the keys file in some of the labs are 8 bit ascii representations of keyboard characters with leading 0's.
